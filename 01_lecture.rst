1. Intro, interpreter, number, boolean
======================================

Introducing
-----------

- Ask everyone to introduce themselves (name, age, base, expect, ...)
- After this course,
If you want to get a job, you must try very best to be the top of the class
If you want to do homework, you just need to finish the course as
requested.
If you don't do what you needed to be done, leave before you lose money!

How to be a good developer
--------------------------

- English. (READ)
- Self-learning.
(So I'm here to teach you do these)
- No magic mind set.

Python
------

- Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic
  data types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power with very clear
  syntax.
- Cpython
- High level
- General-purpose: science computation, network services, webs, games, system scripting ...

Basic Python in 5 mins
----------------------

::

  + - * / ** % name > < == != list string

Number
------

- int, float
- operator: ``+ - * / ** // %`` - scale the problem up
- boolean
- object and object type (type() function)
- assign variable / binding name
- print
- exception understanding
- indentation
- float precision
- modulo application: convert to binary, find even/odd, cryptography,
  minify size of problems

Boolean
-------

- and/or/not
- short-circuit (``True and False and 1/0``)
