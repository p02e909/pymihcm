Using names.txt https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p022_names.txt
(right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), 
a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it 
into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

You’ve just arrived in sunny St. Augustine, and find yourself amazed by the visionary civic planning that would result in the area in which you now stand: a street grid exactly 10 blocks square.
 
You’re in the northwest corner of this 10 by 10 block area, and would like to take a scenic walk to the southeast corner, while only ever moving south or east.
 
As you begin walking, you wonder to yourself, “how many different paths could I take from this northwest corner to the southeast corner?”
 
You quickly note that if the downtown area were only a 2 block by 2 block grid, there would be 6 distinct paths from one corner to the other (see the diagram at the top of this post).
 
So, how many distinct paths are there through the 10 by 10 downtown area?
